## Objetives 

- Show  non- funtionals requeriments 
- Show blokers bugs
- Present difficulties that may arise when inconsistencies appear in the release notes

## Considerations 

-The issue "  When saving a contact (in the registration or editing) the last character of the name disappears" is not out of scope in the release notes, because we are not driving RN 4

- The issue "Edition - When editing a contact, keep the original and add a new one with the changes" is not out of scope in the release notes, because we are not driving RN 4

-The issue "Delete - There is no option to remove in Firefox (concept of blocking bug)" was fixed but not released in the release notes of the following version but in a later

- The issue "List - Missing the message of no contacts available" was never fixed although reported in the RN3
